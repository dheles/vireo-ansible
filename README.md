# vireo-ansible

## WIP WIP WIP
this project does not install [vireo](https://github.com/TexasDigitalLibrary/Vireo) using ansible... yet

instead, it is a collection of playbooks and automation apparatus
for working with your existing vireo installations to perform
tasks such as replicating anonymized production data in a staging environment.
