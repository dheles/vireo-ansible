# NOTE: this is only useful in an environment were we begin with servers
# to which we already have access as authenticated users, but which do not have
# the standard user account we prefer to use for software
# installation, configuration, and management.
# It is useful for establishing a common, consistent environment
# before proceeding with our other playbooks.
# Current expectation is that configuration will be modified for it,
# it will run in isolation, and then the configs will be reset before proceeding.
# preferred strategy:
# set ansible_ssh_user in group_vars (or elsewhere)
# run: ansible-playbook automation_setup.yml --ask-pass --ask-become-pass
# unset ansible_ssh_user
